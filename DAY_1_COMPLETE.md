## 🎯 Remaining Day 1 Tasks

These are the final setup tasks you should complete before Day 2:

### 1. MetaMask Setup (15 minutes)
If you haven't already:
- [ ] Install MetaMask browser extension
- [ ] Create new wallet
- [ ] **Write down seed phrase on paper**
- [ ] Add Base Sepolia network
- [ ] Get test ETH from faucet

📖 **Guide**: See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions

### 2. Add Private Key to .env (5 minutes)
- [ ] Export private key from MetaMask
- [ ] Open `.env` file
- [ ] Add private key: `PRIVATE_KEY=0x...`
- [ ] Save file
- [ ] **VERIFY** .env is not tracked by git

⚠️ **Security**: Never share your private key or push .env to GitHub!

### 3. Test Deployment (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test local deployment
npm run deploy:local
```

You should see:
- ✅ Contract deploying
- ✅ Contract address
- ✅ Account balance
- ✅ No errors

### 4. Connect to GitHub (15 minutes)
- [ ] Create GitHub account (if needed)
- [ ] Create new repository `agenttip`
- [ ] Connect local project to GitHub
- [ ] Push code
- [ ] Verify .env is NOT on GitHub

📖 **Guide**: See `GITHUB_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
